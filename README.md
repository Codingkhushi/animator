# Key Features
1. Dual Library Support

Manim (v0.19.0): Mathematical visualizations, physics simulations, data plots
P5.js: Interactive graphics, generative art, creative coding experiments

2. Intelligent Code Generation

LLM generates library-specific, executable code from natural language
Automatic API version compatibility checking
Fixes common LLM hallucinations (non-existent methods, wrong parameters)

3. Robust Execution Pipeline

Manim: Isolated Python virtual environments prevent dependency conflicts
P5.js: Sandboxed browser execution with Puppeteer-based video capture
Real-time error handling with user-friendly messages

4. Production-Ready Output

Manim animations exported as high-quality MP4 videos
P5.js sketches recorded with configurable frame rates
Instant preview before download
