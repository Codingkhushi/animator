# 2D-Animation-AI
# This project enables users to generate educational 2D animations through AI-powered code generation, supporting two popular animation libraries:

# Create educational animations from simple text prompts - Users describe what they want to see, and AI generates the complete animation code automatically

# Support for multiple animation frameworks - Choose between Manim (mathematical/scientific visualizations) for precise technical animations or P5.js (creative coding) for interactive artistic animations
# Instant preview and export - See your generated animations immediately in the browser, with options to download Manim videos or record P5.js interactive sketches as video files
